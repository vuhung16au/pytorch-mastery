## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install PyTorch and dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers datasets tensorboard
```

### Running the Tutorial

1. **Open the main notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter lab production_inference_deployment.ipynb
   ```

2. **Or run sections individually:**
   ```bash
   # Test model implementation
   python australian_sentiment_model.py
   
   # Execute notebook sections programmatically  
   jupyter nbconvert --execute production_inference_deployment.ipynb
   ```

## Deployment Methods Comparison

| Method | Use Case | Performance | Complexity | Best For |
|--------|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Evaluation Mode** | Basic inference | Good | Low | Development, testing |
| **TorchScript** | Optimized inference | Better | Medium | Production without Python |
| **C++ Deployment** | High-performance | Best | High | Real-time, embedded systems |
| **TorchServe** | Scalable serving | Good | Medium | Web services, microservices |

## TensorFlow vs PyTorch Deployment

| Aspect | TensorFlow | PyTorch |
|--------|------------|---------|
| **Model Format** | SavedModel, TFLite | TorchScript, ONNX |
| **Serving** | TensorFlow Serving | TorchServe |
| **C++ Deployment** | TensorFlow C++ API | libtorch |
| **Mobile** | TensorFlow Lite | PyTorch Mobile |
| **Optimization** | TensorRT, XLA | TorchScript JIT |

## Key Production Benefits

### 1. Evaluation Mode
- Disables autograd for memory efficiency
- Consistent layer behavior (dropout, batch norm)
- Essential foundation for all deployment methods

### 2. TorchScript  
- Python-independent execution
- JIT compilation optimizations
- Single file deployment (model + weights)
- Cross-platform compatibility

### 3. C++ Deployment
- Zero Python overhead
- Maximum inference performance
- Easy integration with existing C++ systems
- Real-time capabilities

### 4. TorchServe
- RESTful APIs for inference and management
- Automatic scaling based on load
- Multi-model serving with versioning
- Built-in metrics and monitoring

## Sample API Usage (TorchServe)

```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:8080/ping

# Inference request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/predictions/australian_tourism_sentiment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"data": "The Sydney Opera House tour was amazing!"}'

# Batch inference
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/predictions/australian_tourism_sentiment \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"data": ["Sydney is beautiful", "Melbourne coffee is great"]}'
```

## Environment Compatibility

The tutorial includes automatic runtime detection for:
- **Local environments** (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Google Colab** (cloud notebooks)
- **Kaggle** (competition platform)
- **Device detection** (CUDA, MPS, CPU)

## Best Practices Covered

### Production Inference Checklist
1. ‚úÖ Call `model.eval()` before inference
2. ‚úÖ Use `torch.no_grad()` to disable autograd
3. ‚úÖ Ensure consistent input preprocessing
4. ‚úÖ Handle batch dimensions properly
5. ‚úÖ Move tensors to the same device as model
6. ‚úÖ Implement proper error handling
7. ‚úÖ Monitor performance and memory usage

### Model Optimization
- Weight initialization strategies
- Device-aware tensor operations
- Memory-efficient inference patterns
- Cross-platform deployment considerations
