### 🔬 **Research & Learning Context**
- **Not Production-Ready**: While examples follow best practices, they are simplified for learning and may require additional robustness for production use
- **Example Datasets**: Australian tourism and cultural examples are created for educational demonstration and may not reflect complete real-world datasets
- **Framework Comparisons**: TensorFlow vs PyTorch comparisons are based on common patterns and may not cover all edge cases or latest framework updates

### 🌏 **Cultural & Language Considerations**
- **Australian Context**: Examples use Australian cultural references and locations for educational consistency, but may not represent the full diversity of Australian culture
- **Vietnamese Language**: Translation examples are provided for multilingual learning but should not be considered professional translation services
- **Localization**: Cultural adaptations are educational examples and may require professional localization for commercial applications

### 🔧 **Technical Limitations**
- **Platform Compatibility**: While tested across multiple platforms, individual system configurations may require additional setup
- **Hardware Requirements**: Some examples require GPU acceleration for optimal performance but include CPU fallbacks
- **Dependencies**: External library versions and API changes may affect some examples over time
